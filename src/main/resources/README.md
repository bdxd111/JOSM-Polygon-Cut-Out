# Resources
Put resources that should be accessible from your Java code in this directory.

There can be the following "special" subdirectories here:
* `images/`: for images (especially icons) your plugin needs
* `data/`: mainly for translations in the `*.lang` format. If you use the i18n mechanism of the gradle plugin, you don't need this.
